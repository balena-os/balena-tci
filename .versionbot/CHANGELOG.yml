                Git 2.35.2 was released to fix a security issue with multi-user
                machines. Add `device_dir` to the whitelist to avoid this error.

                Also, let's make sure an error is thrown when the hostapp cannot
                be made public.

                Commit 445d6d1fcfce97f85ffcfedc0083eb658a734321 does not fix
                the issue because it is missing the --global arg without which
                the git config command fails.

                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.
